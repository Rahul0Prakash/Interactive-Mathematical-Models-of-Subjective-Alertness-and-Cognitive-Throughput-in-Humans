## 📖 Overview
This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** implementing **interactive mathematical models** for **subjective alertness and cognitive throughput** based on **circadian rhythms and homeostatic sleep regulation**. The model predicts **alertness fluctuations**, **cognitive performance dips**, and **sleep debt effects** based on individual sleep schedules.

This work was conducted as part of the M.Sc. Usability Engineering thesis:

**📝 "Beyond the Clock: Energy-Based, Mindful Time Management"**  
🏛 Hochschule Rhein-Waal  

The implementation is based on the **Jewett-Kronauer circadian rhythm model (Jewett & Kronauer, 1999)**.
